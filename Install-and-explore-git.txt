What is a Git workflow?
It’s, from my understanding, a branching path that is the recipe to produce a product using Git and Github, or working in a team, etc. It’s used to ensure nothing goes wrong. From what I can understand, usually it begins with everyone in a team cloning the main directory from github, editing files or whatever else, setting them in the staging area, then once everything needed is committed, pushing changes to the main directory.

What did you notice about your learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
I noticed that I had not set up properly so I spent quite a while on that since I had quite a bit of unanswered questions, but it seems to work now. I have a lot of confusion, but I was able to fix a few errors and understand a bit more about Ubuntu and Visual Studio. I believe if I set myself some simple tasks I will be able to learn more very quickly.

Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration?
I would try to understand how locked files interact with Ubuntu and Git. But I do not remember how to make locked files so I will leave that for another day.

Update: I have remembered Toggl exists.
