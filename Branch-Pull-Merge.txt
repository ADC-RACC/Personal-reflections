What is main?
Main is the default or main branch where all of the best working code should be.

Why create a branch?
You create branches to make changes to the project without affecting the main branch. Meaning if something breaks or gets deleted itâ€™s not permanent and can be reverted back to main.

Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?
A little bit. I feel I can understand it better with more practice in groups.
